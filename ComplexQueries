-- ### Exercise 1 - Customer order count

-- Get order count per customer for the month of 2014 January.

-- * Tables - `orders` and `customers`
-- * Data should be sorted in descending order by count and ascending order by customer id.
-- * Output should contain `customer_id`, `customer_fname`, `customer_lname` and `customer_order_count`.

SELECT  customer_id, customer_fname, customer_lname, count(*) AS customer_order_count
FROM  orders 
JOIN customers
ON order_customer_id =customer_id
WHERE order_date>= '2014-01-01 00:00:00'AND order_date <'2014-02-01 00:00:00'
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY 4 DESC;

-- ### Exercise 2 - Dormant Customers

-- Get the customer details who have not placed any order for the month of 2014 January.
-- * Tables - `orders` and `customers`
-- * Output Columns - **All columns from customers as is**
-- * Data should be sorted in ascending order by `customer_id`
-- * Output should contain all the fields from `customers`
-- * Make sure to run below provided validation queries and validate the output.

SELECT DISTINCT c.* 
FROM customers c
LEFT OUTER JOIN orders o
ON  c.customer_id = o.order_customer_id
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
				SELECT DISTINCT order_customer_id
				FROM orders
				WHERE to_char(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') = '2014-01')
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;

SELECT count(DISTINCT order_customer_id)
FROM orders
WHERE to_char(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') = '2014-01';

SELECT count(*)
FROM customers;

-- Get the difference
-- Get the count using solution query, both the difference and this count should match

-- * Hint: You can use `NOT IN` or `NOT EXISTS` or `OUTER JOIN` to solve this problem.
-- ### Exercise 3 - Revenue Per Customer

-- Get the revenue generated by each customer for the month of 2014 January
-- * Tables - `orders`, `order_items` and `customers`
-- * Data should be sorted in descending order by revenue and then ascending order by `customer_id`
-- * Output should contain `customer_id`, `customer_fname`, `customer_lname`, `customer_revenue`.
-- * If there are no orders placed by customer, then the corresponding revenue for a given customer should be 0.
-- * Consider only `COMPLETE` and `CLOSED` orders

SELECT customer_id ,customer_fname,customer_lname,  COALESCE(SUM (order_item_subtotal), 0)  AS customer_revenue
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.order_customer_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi
ON o.order_id = oi.order_item_order_id
WHERE to_char(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') = '2014-01' 
AND order_status IN ('COMPLETE','CLOSED')
GROUP BY customer_id 
ORDER BY customer_revenue DESC , customer_id ASC
;
